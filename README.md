# Ethara AI × ARC AGI Platform

A unified web platform for playing **ARC-AGI-2** puzzles and **ARC-AGI-3** interactive games — built with Flask, SocketIO, and real-time game rendering.

**Live:** Deployed on Railway  
**Stack:** Python 3.12 · Flask · Flask-SocketIO · Eventlet · Gunicorn · arc-agi SDK

---

## Overview

This platform hosts two types of ARC challenges side by side:

- **ARC-AGI-2** — Classic pattern recognition puzzles. Given input/output examples, identify the hidden transformation rule and solve the test grid.
- **ARC-AGI-3** — Real-time interactive game environments. Use keyboard controls to navigate grid-based puzzles with hidden rules, multiple levels, and instant feedback.

The web interface provides a landing page with both sections, card-based browsing with preview thumbnails, and direct game/puzzle launch on click.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

```bash
# Python 3.12+
python --version

# Install dependencies with uv (recommended)
uv sync

# Or with pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run the Web Server (Development)

```bash
# Start the server on port 8080
python web/server.py

# Custom port
PORT=3000 python web/server.py
```

Then open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your browser.

### Run with Gunicorn (Production)

```bash
./start.sh

# Or manually
gunicorn --worker-class eventlet -w 1 --bind 0.0.0.0:8080 web.server:app
```

- **Admin panel** — Delete games with admin credentials

### AGI-2 Puzzle Player (`/arc-agi-2`)

- **Task browser** — Modal with search, tabs, pagination, and card previews
- **Grid editor** — Interactive grid with color palette for solving puzzles
- **Upload custom tasks** — Load your own `.json` puzzle files
- **Validation** — Input/output grid validation with toast notifications

### Navigation

Both game pages have a minimal navbar: **Logo** (links home) + **🏠 HOME** button. No clutter.

## AGI-3 Game Environments

Games are auto-discovered from the `environment_files/` directory. Each game follows this structure:

```
environment_files/
└── <game_id>/
    └── <version>/
        ├── <game_id>.py       # Game logic (extends ARCBaseGame)
        └── metadata.json      # Game metadata
```

### Adding a New Game

1. Create a directory: `environment_files/mygame/v1/`
2. Add `mygame.py` with your game class extending `ARCBaseGame`
3. Add `metadata.json`:

```json
{
  "game_id": "mygame-v1",
  "default_fps": 10,
  "baseline_actions": [15, 20, 25],
  "tags": ["puzzle", "grid"]
}
```

4. Restart the server — the game appears automatically

### Included Games

| Game | Description |
|---|---|
| **pm07-v1** | Pattern Master — 7-level hidden-rule grid puzzle. Arrow keys only. Progressive difficulty from tutorial to Sokoban. |
| **ga85-v1** | Grid puzzle game environment |

### Controls (AGI-3)

| Action | Keyboard | Description |
|---|---|---|
| ACTION1 | `W` / `↑` | Move up |
| ACTION2 | `S` / `↓` | Move down |
| ACTION3 | `A` / `←` | Move left |
| ACTION4 | `D` / `→` | Move right |
| ACTION5 | `Space` / `Enter` | Primary action |
| ACTION6 | Click / Tap | Grid interaction |
| ACTION7 | `Ctrl+Z` | Undo |

## Programmatic Usage

```python
import arc_agi
from arcengine import GameAction

arc = arc_agi.Arcade(environments_dir="./environment_files")
env = arc.make("pm07-v1", seed=0)

# Play with actions
env.step(GameAction.ACTION1)  # Up
env.step(GameAction.ACTION2)  # Down
env.step(GameAction.ACTION3)  # Left
env.step(GameAction.ACTION4)  # Right
env.step(GameAction.ACTION7)  # Undo

# View scorecard
print(arc.get_scorecard())
```

### CLI Play

```bash
# Retro arcade GUI (pygame)
uv run python play_gui.py

# Terminal mode
uv run python play.py

# Random agent
uv run python play.py --agent --steps 500
```

## Deployment

### Docker

```bash
docker build -t arc-platform .
docker run -p 8080:8080 arc-platform
```

### Railway

The project is configured for one-click Railway deployment:

- **Build:** Dockerfile-based (multi-stage, Python 3.12 slim)
- **Start:** `./start.sh` (gunicorn + eventlet)
- **Health check:** `GET /health`
- **Auto-restart:** On failure, max 5 retries
